Dear <%= @talk.speakers[0].first_name %>,

Thank you for your Strange Loop <%= @talk.conf_year %> talk 
submission. The Strange Loop review committee is 
sequestered deep in the Strange Loop bunker where they 
eagerly await your words. In fact, during the review period
we only permit them to receive talk submissions and no
other contact with the outside world.  

The call for presentations ends on June 10th. The review
committee has promised to make all talk decisions by 
June 24th, although they are highly motivated to escape
the bunker and may get back to you sooner.  

If you decide you've made a horrible mistake or forgotten 
something important, please contact alex@thestrangeloop.com.

Thanks for your interest in Strange Loop and good luck!
Alex Miller
