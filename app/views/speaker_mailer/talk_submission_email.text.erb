Dear <%= @talk.speakers[0].first_name %>,

Thank you for your Strange Loop <%= Time.now.year %> talk
submission. The Strange Loop review committee is
sequestered deep in the Strange Loop bunker where they
eagerly await your words. In fact, during the review period
we only permit them to receive talk submissions and no
other contact with the outside world.

The call for proposals ends on June 10th. The review
committee has promised to make all talk decisions by
June 24th, although they are highly motivated to escape
the bunker and may get back to you sooner.

If you decide you've made a horrible mistake or forgotten
something important, please contact alex@thestrangeloop.com.

Thanks for your interest in Strange Loop and good luck!
Alex Miller
