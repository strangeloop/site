Dear <%= @talk.speakers[0].first_name %>,

Unfortunately, your talk 
"<%= @talk.title %>" 
has not been accepted for Strange Loop 2011.  This year the 
competition was fierce with over 100 talks submitted for a 
small number of spots.  Many fine talks were rejected by 
necessity. 

I hope you will still be able to attend the conference and 
submit talks in the future.

If you have further questions, please let me know.

Alex Miller
