Dear <%= @talk.speakers[0].first_name %>,

Congratulations!  Your talk "<%= @talk.title %>" has been accepted 
at the Strange Loop Conference.  Your session has been scheduled on 
<%= @talk.date %> at <%= @talk.start %>.  

Now put down your celebratory beverage and read this email for some 
important information and a few things you need to do.  

1) Confirmation 

Please respond to this email and confirm that 
you can attend the conference and that the date/time above is 
acceptable (pending travel... see below).  If you cannot 
speak it is critical that you let me know AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

2) Registration 

Please register as a speaker here (DO NOT share this link):
https://www.regonline.com?eventID=959942&rTypeID=484618

If you've already registered, please remind me so that I can 
update my records and refund your registration.  Registration
is free and the Sunday night speaker dinner is included but
the Sunday workshops and Cardinals game are not and you will 
be charged if you select those optional items.

3) Travel 

We will be using Phil Overton and his firm as a 
travel agent.  I will be giving Phil a list of speakers, their 
location, and their scheduled talk.  He will contact you to work 
through scheduling airfare.  I will schedule your hotel based on 
the travel dates I get from Phil.  I appreciate your flexibility
in scheduling travel that sticks to our budget.  We try to meet 
you halfway.  If travel prevents your scheduled talk time from
working, we will adjust as needed. 

Workshop speakers will receive up to 4 nights of hotel (Saturday
to Wednesday) and session speakers will receive up to 3 nights 
of hotel (Sunday to Wednesday).  If you want extra days or 
special travel arrangements at your own cost, Phil can help work 
that out.

4) Promotion

We appreciate any help you can give us in getting out the word 
about the conference - Twitter, local or topical mailing lists, 
Facebook, LinkedIn, Hacker News, Reddit, wherever!
